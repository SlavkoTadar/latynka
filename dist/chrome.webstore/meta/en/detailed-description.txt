This extension converts web pages with Ukrainian Cyrillic text to Latin script.

The cause for it is a font used on the page not handling Latin or extended Latin characters, like č and ž. To show these characters, browser will choose another font, which would change original page look.

The extension is open-source, and has to ads or trackers, development is fully transparent.
